# Student Depression Prediction System

This project implements a machine learning–based system to predict the risk of depression among students using academic, lifestyle, and behavioral indicators. The goal is to demonstrate how data-driven approaches can be applied to analyze mental health–related patterns in an educational context.

---

## Project Overview

Student mental health is influenced by multiple factors such as academic workload, sleep patterns, stress levels, and social interaction. This project explores these factors through data analysis and builds a predictive model to identify students who may be at risk of depression.

This system is developed strictly for educational and research purposes and is not intended for clinical or medical use.
